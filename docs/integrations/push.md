## Push Notifications

### Setup

Add **iOS** or **Android** push notifications in an instant.

1. Follow these tutorials to get set up on each platform:
    - [iOS](https://scaphold.io/community/blog/iOS-push-notifications-with-graphql/)
    - [Android](https://scaphold.io/community/blog/android-push-notifications-with-graphql/)
2. Add the push integration for the platform of your choice and upload the appropriate keys through our Integrations Portal.
3. Immediately get access to iOS or Android push notifications via your app's GraphQL API.
