## Subscriptions With React

Let's look at a more real world example using React. Apollo comes packed with really nice React bindings
that we can use to simplify the process of subscribing to data and merging new data into the client-side cache.

Take a minute to look over this file. Apollo does a great job allowing us to use real-time subscriptions alongside traditional queries and mutations. The combination of `subscribeToMore` and `updateQuery` offer a powerful set of tools to keep our UI up to date when dealing with real-time data!

    [See the complete code on GitHub](https://github.com/scaphold-io/slackr-graphql-subscriptions-starter-kit/blob/master/src/components/messages.jsx)

The `returnPartialData: true` option is important. When you want to use `subscribeToMore` to merge results into the result of a normal query it is necessary to specify this.

A few things are going on here. To make sense of what is happening, lets start from the logical beginning which actually occurs at the end of the file. See this line `const MessagesWithData = compose(graphql(ChannelMessagesQuery, ...));`. This is the standard way to use Apollo to connect a react component with data from a GraphQL query. The `graphql` function will wrap our component in a higher-order component that grabs our data and makes it available to our component via its `props`. In this example, we will be able to access our `Channel` data from our component with `this.props.data.getChannel` as soon as it is fetched.

Okay so we have connected our component with a regular old GraphQL query, but how do we make it real-time? The key is the method `subscribeToMore`.  Look at our `subscribeToNewMessages` method. Apollo's `graphql` function fits our component with the data prop that exposes the `subscribeToMore` method. We use this method to attach a subscription query which then calls the `updateQuery` method we pass in every time a new peice of data is pushed from the server. The object we return from `updateQuery` is then merged with our previous results and persisted in the client side cache. This way, `this.props.data.getChannel...` is always kept up to date and we can use it like normal to render our UI.

    Condensed example from our Slackr app

import { graphql, compose } from 'react-apollo';
import gql from 'graphql-tag';

const ChannelMessagesQuery = gql`

  getChannel(id: $channelId) {
    id
    name
    messages(last: 50, orderBy: $messageOrder) {
      edges {
        node {
