# Logs & Examples

## Logs

That wraps up our Logic tutorial! As you start using Logic, please not that you can see logs for each of your logic functions using the 'View Logs' button in the table dropdown when you click on a Pre or Post operation buttons. You can also easily enable and disable functions at any time.


We hope you enjoy Logic and we'd love to hear your feedback! As a final ode to our discussion of how you can use logic to help build Slack, we'd love for you to <a href="http://slack.scaphold.io">join our Slack</a>. It's an awesome community of people building cool applications with GraphQL and we'd love to see you there!
